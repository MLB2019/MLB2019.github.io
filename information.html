               applicants out to Thailand to spend their Summer having fun and working at Camp.
               With teams based in both the UK and Thailand, we have a wealth of knowledge to ensure
               that our applicants are provided with the best support. Not only does Camp Thailand
               provide safe, friendly and fun Summer Camp positions, we also provide all applicants
               with the full training they will need to immerse themselves in local schools
               (no matter their previous experience). Our applicants will be given an
               internationally accredited, 30 hour Teaching Young Learners Qualification. We also
               run an orientation and teaching seminar once they arrive in Thailand, to give them
               that extra boost of confidence before they hit the classrooms!</p>
             <p>Camp Thailand provide full support to your son/daughter throughout the whole process.
               From submitting their application to when they leave Thailand, there will always be
               someone to help. All applicants are met at the airport and are taken to their
               accommodation for their first night in Bangkok, before we then transport them by VIP
               bus straight to Camp. During these two days, we ensure all applicants meet other Camp
               mates, get all the information they need and get fully settled in and are prepared for
               their adventure ahead!</p>

             <div class="text-dark"><p>On all of our programs, we can offer applicants guidance in their
               visa application process. Most applicants will enter the country on a 30 day Tourist Visa,
               depending upon how long they want to stay in Thailand for. If your son or daughter plan
               to stay in Thailand for longer than 30 days, they should apply for a single entry Thai
               tourist visa which will cover them for 60 days. Camp Thailand will help all applicants
               through the visa application process, so there is nothing to worry about.</p></div><br>
